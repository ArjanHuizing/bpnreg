Warren, Rothman, Schnapp, & Ericson, "Wormholes in virtual space: From cognitive maps to cognitive graphs"Data File StructureTab-delimited text files1.  Wormhole_Exp1_Learning.txtNumber of trials to criterion during the training phase of Experiment 1.Columns A-B:  Euclidean MazeColumns D-E:  Wormhole MazeRows 4-13:  Route groupsRows 14-23:  Shortcut groups2.  Wormhole_Exp1_RouteChoice.txtNumber of wormhole routes and other routes taken on probe trials during the Route Test of Experiment 1, by object pair.Columns A-G:  Euclidean MazeColumns I-O:  Wormhole Maze3.  Wormhole_Exp1_RouteLength.txtMean path length (m) for probe trials during the Route Test of Experiment 1, by object pair.Columns A-C:  Euclidean MazeColumns E-G:  Wormhole Maze4.  Wormhole_Exp1_RouteTime.txtMean travel time (s) on probe trials during the Route Test of Experiment 1, by object pair.Columns A-C:  Euclidean MazeColumns E-G:  Wormhole Maze5.  Wormhole_Exp1_ShortcutEuclidean.txtMean initial angular constant errors (deg) in the Euclidean maze: initial direction of walking with respect to the Euclidean target location during the Shortcut Test of Experiment 1, circular means by object pair, and angular deviation (AD).  Rows 1-16:  Probe trials, normalized so increasing error is in the direction of the target's wormhole location in the matched Wormhole maze (mean of 4 trials per cell).Rows 19-34:  Standard trials, increasing error is to the right of the target's Euclidean location (mean of 2 trials per cell).  These trials are not normalized because a wormhole location for standard targets is undefined.6.  Wormhole_Exp1_ShortcutWormhole.txtMean initial angular constant errors (deg) in the Wormhole maze: initial direction of walking with respect to the Euclidean target location during the Shortcut Test of Experiment 1, circular means by object pair, and angular deviations (AD).Rows 1-16:  Probe trials, normalized so increasing error is in the direction of the target's wormhole location (mean of 4 trials per cell).Rows 19-34:  Standard trials, increasing error is to the right of the target's Euclidean location (mean of 2 trials per cell).  These trials are not normalized because a wormhole location for standard targets is undefined.7.  Wormhole_Exp2_ShortcutsOverall.txtMean initial angular constant errors (deg) in the Wormhole maze: initial direction of walking with respect to the Euclidean target location, normalized so increasing error is in the direction of the target's wormhole location, during the Shortcut Test of Experiment 2, circular means and angular deviations (AD) for all probe, neighbor, and stranger objects (Near + Far).Columns A-D:  Mean constant error and ADColumns F-I:  Within-subject AD (all trials)8.  Wormhole_Exp2_ShortcutsByObject.txtMean initial angular constant errors (deg) in the Wormhole maze: initial direction of walking with respect to the Euclidean target location, normalized so increasing error is in the direction of the target's wormhole location, during the Shortcut Test of Experiment 2, circular means and angular deviations (AD) by start and target object (mean of 3 trials per cell).Rows 1-19:  Near Start ObjectsRows 24-42:  Far Start Objects
